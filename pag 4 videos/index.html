            <p> Skateboarding is an action sport originating in the United States that involves riding and performing 
            tricks using a skateboard, as well as a recreational activity, an art form, an entertainment industry job,
            and a method of transportation. Skateboarding has been shaped and influenced by many skateboarders 
            throughout the years. A 2009 report found that the skateboarding market is worth an estimated $4.8 billion 
            in annual revenue, with 11.08 million active skateboarders in the world. In 2016, it was announced that 
            skateboarding will be represented at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, for both male and female teams.
            Since the 1970s, skateparks have been constructed specifically for use by skateboarders, freestyle BMXers, 
            aggressive skaters, and very recently, scooters. However, skateboarding has become controversial in areas 
            in which the activity, although illegal, has damaged curbs, stoneworks, steps, benches, plazas, and parks.</p>
